        A single envelope for every WebSocket event.

        • **chat**   → `message` + `timestamp` are present  
        • **paired** → `expiresAt` is present (when the round ends)  
        • **time_up**→ `timestamp` is present (when the round actually ends)

        All other combinations are ignored by the server.
